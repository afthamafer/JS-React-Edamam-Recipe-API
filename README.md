NOTE: To use this application you need to use your OWN Edamam ID and key. I changed mine in the code for privacy purposes.

To do this first you need an account on https://developer.edamam.com/edamam-recipe-api
After that you can place your own ID and Key in the file called: App.js  >
const APP_ID = "OWNID";
const APP_KEY = "OWNKEY ";
